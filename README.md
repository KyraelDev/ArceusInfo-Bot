# ArceusInfo-Bot
This is the repository for my little bot, ArceusInfo
This bot is based upon PokeAPI, and is written in Python (Only json file is a config file that you could personalize at will).
Here you will find the source code used to make this bot function, the comments are written in Italian, feel free to check the code or comment possible edits I could do to improve this.
Thank you very much for using ArceusInfo!
